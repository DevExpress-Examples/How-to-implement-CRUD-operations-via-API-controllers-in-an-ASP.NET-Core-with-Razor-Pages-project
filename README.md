# How to implement CRUD operations via API controllers in an ASP.NET Core with Razor Pages project

This example demonstrates how to bind dxDataGrid to a controller action and implement CRUD operations via an API controller in a Razor Pages project.
Set the Controller, LoadAction, UpdateAction, InsertAction and DeleteAction options so that dxDataGrid's data source can perform CRUD operations. In the corresponding controller, implement data opeartions in the corresponding actions.

Note that it is necessary to correctly setup routing to razor pages and controllers.
